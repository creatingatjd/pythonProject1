  <p>“True yoga is not about the shape of your body, but the shape of your life.<br> Yoga is not to be performed; yoga is to be lived. Yoga doesn’t care about what you have been; yoga cares about the person you are becoming.<br> Yoga is designed for a vast and profound purpose, and for it to be truly called yoga, its essence must be embodied.”</q>
  <br><br>At Inner Engineering, yoga is taught in its full depth and dimension and communicated on an experiential level. The programs provide methods for establishing oneself in a way of life that affirms wholeness and vitality. They show that spiritual life does not deny worldly, social, and family responsibilities, but rather uses them as vehicles for personal growth and self-realization.
      An array of programs are conducted regularly by Isha worldwide. The programs involve simple postures, meditation and powerful ways of transforming one's energies. They do not require physical agility or any previous knowledge or experience of yoga.
      Tailored to suit individuals from every social and cultural background, Inner Engineering Yoga programs provide powerful tools for inner exploration.</p></div>
